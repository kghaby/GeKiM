# TODO

- lots of comments in files
- use lmfit, pytorch, tensorflow, deeptime, etc for inspiration on architecture and philosophy
  - use nn's to get a sense of how and why and usecases for this
- more precise reqs
- Subspecies and better scheme generation so that i dont have to make entirely new copied transitions for modified species, like L and Lsil. 
  - maybe subspecies can share transitions?
